    <h1>Trust The Process</h1>
    <p>Tried and true. Our process works for new Shopify stores, or any e-commerice store migrating to Shopify. You will be assigned a project manager who will lead our in-house team on the path of scalibility.</p>

    <h2>01. Discovery</h2>
    <p>You've given us the keys to your brand's web future, great call. In phase one we'll dive into your current storefront and assess what will be needed to increase your conversion rate, as well as plan out a roadmap to success. Buckle up, and beare down. It's about to get real.</p>

    <h2>02. Design</h2>
    <p>Time to make this thing pretty. In the design phase we'll be providing wireframes, information architectures, mockups, and assets that will be the guidelines before the developers get their eager hands on it. You can be assured final designs will be provided with current UI/UX ecommerce best practice, and a personal touch you won't find anywhere else.</p>

    <h2>03. Develop</h2>
    <p>We're developers at our core. Your approved designs will be coded into a feature-rich, state of the art Shopify theme with all the bells and whistles. Your custom storefront will be developed with site speed and mobile friendliness being the top two priorities. We'll be providing three development environments so you can review your site as we keep working in the background.</p>

    <h2>04. Launch</h2>
    <p>The big day. Once the development storefront has gone through a rigorous QA process, we'll plan a launch date with you and take your site through our custom go-live checklist. We'll ensure the purchase funnel has been tested to the very end, and take pride in being order #0001.</p>

    <h2>05. Optimize</h2>
    <p>The work isn't over yet... Once your site is launched, after a small window of celebration, we'll be right back to work. Using industry leading analytics tools, we'll identify areas of the site that can be improved immediately. This way, we can increase conversion rate starting from launch day. We're here as your partner, not just an internet general contractor.</p>
